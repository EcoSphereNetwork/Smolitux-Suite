The project is a modular visualization platform for distributed AI infrastructures that graphically represents complex backend systems. It includes interactive nodes for chatbots, LLM servers, and databases, as well as dynamic route visualization. Inspired by the GUI concepts of Superalgos, the platform offers real-time status displays and integrated configuration interfaces. The application uses React and WebSocket to provide an intuitive and scalable user experience. The goal is to simplify the management and monitoring of distributed AI systems.

Create a new GitHub repository for the project. Once you have finished your work, push everything to GitHub.

Use this Template as base Code strukture:
https://github.com/creativetimofficial/vue-black-dashboard.git

Implement the (old Superalgos GUI) new Smolitux-Suite into vue-black-dashboard as new Page called "Suite"

Your task is to copy only the GUI components from Superalgos and use them in the new project called Smolitux-Suite. Here's a guide on how you could do this:

    Download Superalgos source code:
    Clone the Superalgos repository from GitHub:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos.git

Identify GUI components:
Most GUI components are located in the Client folder of the project. Navigate to:

text
Superalgos/Client/

Copy relevant components:
Copy the components relevant to the project into the new project folder. Pay special attention to folders such as:

    Source/
    UI/
    WebServer/

Check dependencies:
Open the package.json file in the Superalgos project and note the dependencies used for the GUI components.
Set up new project:
Create a new project and initialize it:

bash
mkdir Smolitux-Suite
cd Smolitux-Suite
npm init -y

Install dependencies:
Install the necessary dependencies in the new project:

bash
npm install react react-dom [other-required-packages]

Adapt components:
You may need to modify the copied components to separate them from Superalgos-specific dependencies.
Integrate components into the project:
Import and use the components in the new project:

javascript
import { MyComponent } from './path/to/component';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

    Adjust styling:
    Copy relevant CSS files or Styled Components and adjust them as needed.

Based on the description and functions of Superalgos, the following GUI elements can be adapted for the project:

    Network hierarchy visualization
    Node design
    Configuration menu
    Connection lines
    Information panels
    Mini-chat window
    Zoom and pan functions
    Context menus
    Search function
    Status indicators

Always change the name of the component. ALWAYS replace Superalgos with Smolitux or Smolitux-Suite. Smolitux is the entire framework, Smolitux-Suite is the main app that has integrated all other apps. To implement these elements in your project:

    Copy the relevant React components from the Superalgos source code.
    Adapt the components to your project-specific data structures and requirements.
    Implement the logic to display your backend components as nodes.
    Create custom rendering logic for the routes between nodes.
    Develop a custom chat window component that can be displayed next to the nodes.

You will need to make significant adjustments to optimize the Superalgos GUI elements for this specific use case. It might be sensible to use the basic concepts as inspiration and then develop your own, tailored components that are precisely customized for your project."
