Project Description:
Smolitux-Suite is a modular visualization platform designed to simplify the management and monitoring of distributed AI infrastructures. Inspired by Superalgos, it features an interactive GUI for visualizing network hierarchies, real-time status updates, and dynamic routes between chatbots, LLM servers, and databases. Built on the Vue.js framework with the vue-black-dashboard template, it integrates intuitive interfaces and scalable components to enhance user experience.
